And she was always so defensive
Like nothing was ever her fault
Or her responsibility

And this is all i have left to hold
A delicate balance has been exposed
And now it towers around us all
Just goes to show life is so fragile

She used to smile when she'd say
"It's all so meaningless, anyway
So just forget, forget it"
And she was always so morose
Like this was all some bitter joke
But no one was laughing

And now when we speak about her
We never use the present tense
I guess that's what happens
